<p>Effective from 15 May 2015.</p>

<p>TheRooms Pty Ltd (ABN 87 168 982 821) (including its agents, contractors and assigns, referred to as ìprized.tvî, ìweî, ìourî or ìusî) is committed to protecting and respecting your privacy, and takes its obligations under the Australian privacy legislation very seriously. </p>

<p>This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, transfer and disclose the personal information we collect and hold, and why we do so.  It applies to all of our operations, including visitors to the website at the URL  www.prized.tv (the ìWebsiteî, which includes any and all digital platforms over which we offer our services).  By using the Website you consent to the Privacy Policy.  We do not make any representations about third party websites that may be linked to our Website.</p>

<p>We have implemented practices and procedures to comply with the law, to maintain the confidentiality and security of personal information we collect and hold, and to deal with personal information in an open and transparent way.</p>
<br>
<h4>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h4>

<p>In this Privacy Policy ìpersonal informationî means information or an opinion about a person who is identified, or who can reasonably be identified from that information.  The kinds of personal information we collect and hold include:</p>

<li>contact details (including email addresses);</li>

<li>names;</li>

<li>occupations;</li> <p>and

details of your visits to our site (including traffic and location information, your IP address, operating system and browser type, which pages you visit, weblogs and other communication information).</p>

<p>We do not collect all of the types of personal information listed above in relation to each person who visits our Website.  In many cases, we may have only one or two pieces of information relating to any particular person.</p>
<br>
<h4>WHY WE COLLECT PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>

<p>We collect personal information, including when you register with us, for a number of purposes, including enabling you to take full advantage of our Website and services.  For example, you may voluntarily submit personal information so that we can provide you with further information or respond to your requests or enquiries.</p>

<p>We may also collect your personal information from time to time for any the following purposes: </p>

<li>to personalise and customise your experience when using our Website (including so that our Website is presented in the most effective manner for you and for your devices);</li>

<li>to manage and enhance our products and services;</li>

<li>for network analysis, security and system administration (including providing support services to customers);</li>

<li>to allow you to participate in any available interactive features of our Website;</li>

<li>to investigate any complaints about or by you, or if we have reason to suspect that you are in breach of any of our terms and conditions or have engaged in any unlawful activity;</li> <li>or

as required or permitted by any law (including Australian privacy legislation).</li>

<p>Your personal information may be used for the purposes for which it was submitted or collected, or for a related purpose.  We may also use your personal information in connection with the general management of our Website and in connection with providing our services.</p>

<p>Your personal information may also be used for ensuring business continuity, maintaining business records and strategic planning and management.  We may also use your personal information when complying with legal and regulatory requirements, complying with audits, defending or pursuing litigation and our other record keeping and reporting obligations.</p>
<br>
<h4>HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION</h4>

<p>When you visit our Website, we may collect information about your computer, including your IP address, operating system and browser type through the use of ìcookiesî, ìappletsî or similar devices or programs.  This aggregated, de-personalised information assists us to customise your experience of our Website, and to analyse the usage of our Website.</p>

<p>If you contact us (for example, if you submit a request or comment to us or choose to register or create an account with us), we may collect personal information you provide for that purpose or for a related purpose.  We may also collect your personal information when you post material to our site or to any of our social media profiles. </p>

<p>From time to time, when collecting information from you, we may also ask you to ìopt inî to consent to us using or disclosing your personal information other than in accordance with this Privacy Policy or any applicable law. As part of our commitment to protecting your privacy, you will also be given the opportunity to ìopt outî from receiving communications from us or from third parties that send communications to you in accordance with this Privacy Policy or in accordance with any additional consent you give, and we will comply with your decision.</p>
<br>
<h4>DISCLOSURE</h4>

<p>We will only disclose your personal information (including to trusted third parties) for the purposes for which it was primarily collected or for a related purpose. We will only disclose your sensitive personal information with your consent.  We may also share your personal information with government agencies where we are requested or required to do so.
</p>
<p>We will use best endeavours to put arrangements and requirements in place to reasonably provide an adequate level of protection of your information, so that third parties who receive your personal information will also protect its security and confidentiality.</p>
<br>
<h4>SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION</h4>

<p>We will take reasonable and appropriate steps to keep your personal information we host or collect secure. For example, we will, where reasonable, implement appropriate technical safeguards in relation to your personal information such as password protection, controlled access and data encryption.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the transmission of information via the internet (by way of an email or otherwise) is never completely secure. While we will take reasonable measures to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to or from our Website, and any transmission is at your own risk.</p>
<br>
<h4>RETENTION OF YOUR INFORMATION</h4>

<p>In general, we will retain your personal information only for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, after which we will take all steps that are reasonable in the circumstances to destroy or de-identify it.</p>
